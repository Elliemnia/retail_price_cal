# retail_price_cal
An application that accepts, from the user, the wholesale cost of an item and it's markup percentage. For example, if an item's wholesale cost is $10 dollars and it's retail price is $20, then the markup is 100%. 
In addition to working code for the calculation, add data validation to ensure the values entered are positive and numeric. If the data is not valid add a label/message that lets the user know that the data entered is not valid.
The program should contain a function named CalcRetailPrice that receives wholesale costs and markup percentage as arguments, and returns the retail price of the item.
